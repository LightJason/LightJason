The multi-agent framework is split up into different parts. Each component has got its own documentation. At this section, we would like to give an overview over all elements within the framework. All frameworks are published to [Maven Central](http://mvnrepository.com).

The source codes are written in Java (latest release version) with a defined syntax structure and all code documentation will be created with [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org). We are also using unit testing and the [Git-Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) developing model.

This component defines the main agent structure. It defines the whole syntax and the base agent structure. It also supports an agent generator and configuration, so that you can create a set of agents by an ASL-file. Based on the interface structure, you can redefine all elements if you like. A full [railroad diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_diagram) of our _AgentSpeak(L++)_ syntax can be found on the feature page.

### Benchmarking Emergency Scenario

The video present a performance test of our framework with 15.000 agents on an emergency scenarion. The video is running in realtime on a single computer (iMac with 2,9 GHz Intel Core i5, 16 GB RAM and OSX El Captain 10.11.6).

> The agents calculates their landmarks to the exit point (position 140 / 140 in the middle) on a grid world with 250x250 cells and starts walking. If a cell is block by another agent, the agents tries to go to the right side, if not possible to the left side, if this is not possible, the agent stops walking and waits a random time for continuing walking. If the agent don't reach a landmark within 5 times, he skips the landmark and start walking to the next one except the exit point.

A [REST-API (ReSTful)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) is a system to define communication over [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) for distributed systems. We are supporting such a REST-API to control a set of agents which can be also grouped.
