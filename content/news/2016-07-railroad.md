title: "Add Railroad / Syntax Diagrams"
categories: ["Documentation"]
---
For our [AgentSpeak(L++)](/framework/agentspeak) language definition, we have created [railroad / syntax diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_diagram) based on the [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form) grammar definition. <!--more--> 

There are two main diagram types. The diagram are interactive so the grammar rules can be swapped and each element within a rule is clickable and referenced its own definition. The grammar files will be generated automatically based on the current source code definition
