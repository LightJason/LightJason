The AgentSpeak(L++) component will be used in the [DAIMON](http://www.daimonproject.com/) project.<!--more-->

The project combines neuronal networks with a multi-agent system for calculating a risk value. In combination with our [scratchpad](/news/2017-11-scratchpad) development we extend AgentSpeak with neuronal networks e.g. deep-learning and combine all into an artificial intelligence decision aid tool.
