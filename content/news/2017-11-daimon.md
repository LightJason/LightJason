The AgentSpeak(L++) component will find further use in the [DAIMON](http://www.daimonproject.com/) project.<!--more-->

The project combines neuronal networks with a multi-agent system for calculating risk values.
In combination with our [scratchpad](/news/2017-11-scratchpad) we intend to extend AgentSpeak(L++) with neuronal networks, e.g. deep-learning to provide an artificial intelligence decision aid tool.
