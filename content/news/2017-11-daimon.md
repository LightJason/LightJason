The AgentSpeak(L++) component will find further use in the [DAIMON](http://www.daimonproject.com/) project.<!--more-->

The project combines neuronal networks with a multi-agent system for calculating risk values. The multi-agent system is to be used to develop the individual tasks for exploring the data, communication with the neural networks and communication with the user interface in fine granular form. With this project we intend to extend AgentSpeak(L++) with neuronal networks, e.g. deep-learning to provide an artificial intelligence decision aid tool.
