title: "Code-Cleanup, Test-Case Coverage and Serializable Components"
categories: ["Project"]
---

A large update of the AgentSpeak components extends the framework for distributed architectures, defense programming and analysing and increases the code coverage. 
<!--more--> 

We are currently within the workflow of the _first release_. The main components are refactored to a more useable and simplified architecture and we are extending the unit-testing; we try to reach 90% code coverage. We extend the framework also with annotations which can be analysed by [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) and we extend all framework components with the [Java Serializable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jndi/objects/serial.html) structure to build _distributed systems_.
