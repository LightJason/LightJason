categories: ["Project"]

A large update of the AgentSpeak components extends the framework for distributed architectures, [defensive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming) and analysing and increases the code coverage. 
<!--more--> 

We are currently within the workflow of the _first release_. The main components are refactored to a more usable and simplified architecture and we are extending the unit-testing; we try to reach 90% code coverage. We extend the framework also with annotations which can be analysed by [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) and we extend all framework components with Java's [_Serializable Objects_](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jndi/objects/serial.html) structure to build _distributed systems_.
