categories: ["Project"]

A large update of the AgentSpeak components extends the framework for distributed architectures, defense programming and analysing and increase the code coverage. 
<!--more--> 

A main code clean-up and current unit test-cases the preprocessing workflow of the _first release_. The main components are refactored to a more useable and simplified architecture and we are extend the unit-testing so we try to reach 90% code coverage. We extend the framework also with annotations which can be analysed by FindBugs and we extend all framework components with the [Java Serializable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jndi/objects/serial.html) structure to build _distributed systems_
