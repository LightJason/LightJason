We created a _traffic simulation game_ for the [Socal Cars Multi-Agent Workshop](https://www.socialcars.org/).

The last 3 months were hard work for us, so a very large thank-you to my colleague Malte, Sophie and my student assistant Ehsan for a great job.
Our task was: 

## Scenario

Preparing a workshop for PhD students which shows a multi-agent simulation. We decided on a _traffic game_ with the following definition:

* create a street with 50km length
* there are 4 segments with different speed settings
* the user should create an agent which drives the vehicle
* the user gets a penalty on slow or fast driving, so the goal is driving the allowed / optimal speed

## Features

Some features are

* the environment and the street segments are also modelled as an agent
* the GUI is complete browser-based with a game engine and state-of-the-art technologies (REST & Websockets)
* other vehicles are also modelled as agents
* each vehicle can pull out or pull in

## Technical details

* Our Web-Application is a single bundled jar of programs with all necessary components and a web-based GUI.
* The _runtime_ executes the agents as concurrent entities to simulate independent vehicles.
* A visualisation of agents and environment is realised using [_phaser_](https://phaser.io).
* For the challenge part of the exercise, we visualise the statistical results, e.g. penalties via web technologies.
* For the communication between the browser frontend and the Java backend, we used Ajax and
 and websockets.
* [_Jetty_](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) serves as a websocket endpoint.
* For the browser interface we were using [_Bootstrap_](https://getbootstrap.com/).

The traffic movement creates a continuous data flow to the websocket, i.e. the backend sends the  changes in movement of the vehicle agent to the browser. In the browser session, the visualisation is done by a tilemap with the JavaScript game engine _phaser_. Based on an interactive GUI the user can change how the agent moves during the simulation is executed. This interaction is technically realised with Ajax and websocket calls.

## Download

You can download the source code and binary jar file

{{< githubrelease user="LightJason" repo="Examples" filter="workshop-trafficsimulation" zip="true" names="trafficsimulation-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar=Jar Executable" >}}

If you run the Jar file you can find a configuration under ```~/.lightjason/trafficsimulation```. Within the configuration you can enable all agents. Documentation of MAS, LightJason and the scenario are built-in as a slide-show. All parts of the game are open-source and we will publish it later as an online game.
