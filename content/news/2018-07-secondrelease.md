We are planning the second release and would like to announce new features in LightJason

<!--more-->

* Machine Learning algorithms like Deep-Learning, Decision Trees, ...
* native Prolog integration for execution Prolog scripts within an action
* Lazy-Action-Loading to reduce memory consumption on creating agent generator
* Lambda-Expression-Stream to create for any Java object a streaming operator for iterate over any object
* Complete redesign backend model to speed-up the execution perfomance and reducing data structures
* Portage to Java 10 (OpenJDK)
* Redesign fuzzy-opertation with Java streams

Additional topics we are working on:

* We have benchmarked LightJason on a Raspberry Pi with very good results
* We have tested LightJason to controll a [Parrot Bebop 2](https://www.parrot.com/de/drohnen/parrot-bebop-2) drone, hopefully we can present some videos soon
* building a concept to port LightJason to C++ so agent script can be executed on a native port

If you have any question just write us for more details.
