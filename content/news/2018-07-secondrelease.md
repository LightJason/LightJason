We are planning the second release and would like to announce new features in LightJason.

<!--More-->>

* Machine learning algorithms such as deep learning, decision trees,.....
* native Prolog integration for executing prolog scripts within an action
* Lazy action loading to reduce memory consumption when creating the agent generator
* Lambda expression stream to create a streaming operator for iteration over the data for each Java object.
* Complete redesign of the backend model to accelerate execution performance and reduce data structures
* Porting to Java 11 (OpenJDK)
* Redesign of the fuzzy operation using Java streams


Other topics we are working on:

* We tested LightJason on a Raspberry Pi with very good results.
* We have tested LightJason to control a [Parrot Bebop 2](https://www.parrot.com/de/drohnen/parrot-bebop-2) drone, hopefully we can present some videos soon.
* Development of a concept for porting LightJason to C++, so that agent scripts can be executed natively

If you have any questions, just write us for more information.
