We have joined the [Docker-Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/lightjason/) community with LightJason. <!--more-->

You find a current (minimal) prebuild docker container, which contains a Java development environment with a current [AgentSpeak(L++) developer build](https://hub.docker.com/r/lightjason/agentspeak/). This build has got the following definition:

* based on [Linux Alpine 3.7](https://alpinelinux.org/)
* Glibc & Git installation
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) build system
* [Oracle Java 8 Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

The container is public, so you can extend it for your needs. Changes on AgentSpeak(L++) will automatically trigger container updates. We will set up different versions of this container when the first release is finished.
