Updated the [knowledge base](/knowledgebase) and [tutorials](/tutorials) and added an [example repository](https://github.com/LightJason/Examples) with source codes and generated jar files also: <!--more-->

* We reduced the tutorials, so that each tutorial contains only _one_ description with sources. For each tutorial we created a _full working_ example and explain it.
* On the knowledge base we put a schematic illustration of our _agent cycle_ and compare it with the original Jason cycle.

Tutorials and knowledge base are _heavily under developing_, because we would like to use LightJason also in teaching
