We are working on a full documentation of all [buildin actions](/knowledgebase/actions) in LightJason. <!--more-->

The documentation contains the main description of each action, a short code example, the reference to the source code of the action and optional additional information of the functionality of the action.

We address this to the _agent developer_ to take a look into the documentation for create your own agents. We try to support a lot of data structures and elements to get a _high abstraction_ to write your agent.

If you have any suggestions to add more features please let us know...
