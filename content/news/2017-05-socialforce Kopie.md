title: "Social-Force for Crowd Simulation"
categories: ["Project"]

We added a new subproject that builds a _social force model_ for crowd simulation on top of your agents.
<!--more--> 

Based on our current work on crowd simulation we 
are adding the new repository [SocialForce](https://github.com/LightJason/SocialForce) to your project. This model extends the known [social force model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_force_model) of Dirk Helbing with our agents. We generalized the known model in a more abstract structure with _mind and physical distance_ to get a more complex force structure.
