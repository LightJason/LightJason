We have created the main website of the project, registered the domain [lightjason.org](https://lightjason.org) and right now trying to create the first full Maven package. <!--more--> 

We are working on a first example similar to the _Gold Miners_ scenario (see [JaCaMo](http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/tutorial/gold-miners/)) but with OpenGL support with the Java [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) library. We will be working on the project and the website continuously.
