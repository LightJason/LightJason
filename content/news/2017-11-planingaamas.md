Our current projects [traffic simulation workshop](/news/2017-09-workshop), [scratchpad development](/news/2017-11-scratchpad) and [DAIMON](/news/2017-11-daimon) help us to find real-life use cases for a multi-agent system, so we are planning to present a demonstration at [AAMAS 2018](http://celweb.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/aamas18/callForDemos/).
