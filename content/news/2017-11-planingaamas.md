Our recent practical applications of LightJason in the [SocialCars simulation workshop](/news/2017-09-workshop), our [scratchpad development](/news/2017-11-scratchpad) and the [DAIMON](/news/2017-11-daimon) project helped us to find further real-life use cases for our multi-agent system.
Additionally we plan to submit LightJason for a demonstrator at [AAMAS 2018](http://celweb.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/aamas18/callForDemos/). Fingers crossed!
