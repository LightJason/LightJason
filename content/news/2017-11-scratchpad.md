Based on our [workshop](2017-09-workshop) we are generalising the software to a generic multi-agent system. <!--more-->

The [software](https://github.com/LightJason/Scratchpad) uses current state-of-the-art technologies like [Spring-Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), [Netflix Hysterix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). First performance stress tests of the runtime allows to run 2.5 million of agents on a single desktop computer, so we hope to scale it up on a distributed cloud computer system.
