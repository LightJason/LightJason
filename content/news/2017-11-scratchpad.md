Based on the [SocialCars workshop](2017-09-workshop) we held in September, we generalised LightJason even more to become a modern, generic and full-fledged multi-agent system. <!--more-->

Our [Scratchpad](https://github.com/LightJason/Scratchpad) now uses current state-of-the-art technologies like [Spring-Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), [Netflix Hysterix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).
First promising looking internal performance stress tests of the runtime allowed us to run 2.5 million agents on a single desktop computer. We hope to scale it up on a distributed cloud computer system.
Expect to hear more from us regarding benchmark details and data.
