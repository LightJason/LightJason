We update the tutorials with a short introduction in [efficient beliefbases](/tutorials/efficient-beliefbase) and [communication](/tutorials/communication) <!--more--> 

The [LightJason achitecture](/) allows you to create _on-demand beliefbases_ (which uses a [lazy loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading)) structure. The beliefs within the beliefbase are generated during the agent gets access to the literal. This pattern is very fast and efficient.

The communication of [LightJason](/) does not define any built-in agent communication, so for each scenario you need to create your own communication structure. within the tutorial we show you a baseline example to implement communication.
