In this Section we provide basic and advanced knowledge helpful for understanding the theoretical concepts (and also the [practical tutorials](/tutorials)) of our framework.

* Basic knowledge
  1. [Logic Programming](logicalprogramming) for understanding the difference to imperative programming. Explanation of the basic concepts for using this paradigm to describe the agent behaviour
  2. [Finite-State Machine](finitestatemachine) for understanding the runtime model of the agent behaviour
  3. [Finite-State Machine and Logic Programming of an agent](agent) to understand how we combine the parts into our agent definition
  4. [Difference to Jason](differencetojason) shows the main differences between [Jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net) and our framework
  5. [Actions](actions) provides a reference to all built-in actions

<br>

* Advanced knowledge
  1. [Plan Triggering Techniques](triggering) provides insights into different ways to trigger plans in AgentSpeak(L++)
  2. [Plan Annotations](annotations) shows how to modify the execution behaviour of plans
  3. [Failing is Intentional](failing) explains techniques to mitigate failing plans and actions, as failing is part of ~~humans~~ agents interacting with each other in a shared environment.
