In this Section we provide basic knowledge helpful for understanding the theoretical concepts (and also the [practical tutorials](/tutorials)) of our framework.

1. [Logical Programming](logicalprogramming) for understanding the difference to imperative programming. Explanation of the basic concepts for using this paradigm to describe the agent behaviour
2. [Finite-State-Machine](finitestatemachine) for understanding the runtime model of the agent behaviour
3. [Finite-State-Machine & Logical Programming to an Agent](agent) to understand how we combine the parts into our agent definition
4. [Difference to Jason](differencetojason) shows the main differences between [Jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net) and our framework
5. [Actions](actions) explanation of all built-in actions
