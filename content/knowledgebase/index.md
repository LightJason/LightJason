In this section we provide a background of multi-agent modelling, a gentle introduction into logic programming and basic and advanced knowledge helpful for understanding the theoretical concepts of our framework.

## Background and Introduction
  1. [Logic Programming](logicalprogramming) for understanding the difference to imperative programming. Explanation of the basic concepts for using this paradigm to describe the agent behaviour
  2. [Finite-State Machine](finitestatemachine) for understanding the runtime model of the agent behaviour
  3. [Finite-State Machine and Logic Programming of an agent](agent) to understand how we combine the parts previously discussed into our agent definition
  4. [Difference to Jason](differencetojason) shows the main differences between [Jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net) and our framework


<br>

## Basic Knowledge
  1. [Atoms](atoms) the basic building blocks
  2. [Terms](terms) fit all value- and data-types
  3. [Literals](literals) comprise complex information
  4. [Variables](variables) placeholder to store dynamic information at runtime
  5. [Plans and Logic Rules](plansandrules) to describe complex behaviour
  6. [Goals](goals) mark plans to be executed
  7. [Beliefs and Facts](beliefsandfacts) to store information the agent perceived or deduced from the environment
  8. [Actions](actions) to interact with other agents or the environment
  9. [Built-in Actions](builtinactions) provides a reference to all built-in actions available to LightJason agent programmers
  10. [Unification](unification) to get current values from literals

<br>

## Advanced Knowledge
  1. [Multi-Assignments](multiassignments) explains how to assign the output of actions to a list containing multiple variables
  2. [Plan Triggering Techniques](triggering) provides insights into different ways to trigger plans in AgentSpeak(L++)
  3. [Plan Annotations](annotations) shows how to modify the execution behaviour of plans
  4. [Lambda Expressions](lambdaexpressions) are useful to implement loops over iterable structures likes lists
  5. [Explicit Repair Actions](repairactions) can be used to catch failing actions
  6. [Failing is Intentional](failing) explains techniques to mitigate failing plans and actions, as failing is part of ~~humans~~ agents interacting with each other in a shared environment.
