{{< toc >}}

> All actions are organised within the [action.builtin](http://lightjason.github.io/AgentSpeak/sources/d7/d4b/namespaceorg_1_1lightjason_1_1agentspeak_1_1action_1_1builtin.htm) package. 
> Each packages defines a semantic structure of the actions.
> For an example on how to make use of actions have a look at our [testing agent](https://github.com/LightJason/AgentSpeak/blob/master/src/test/resources/agent/complete.asl) or the [tutorials](/tutorials), which uses many built-in actions provided by AgentSpeak(L++).

The action list below shows all existing built-in actions.
Clicking on the brief description opens a drop-down box containing detailed information and code examples.
