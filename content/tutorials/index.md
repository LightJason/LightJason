In this Section, we introduce LightJason/AgentSpeak(L++) from a *hands-on* perspective by providing tutorials for understanding the practical applications of our framework.

## Basic Tutorials

Having [basic knowledge](/knowledgebase) about the [belief–desire–intention model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%E2%80%93desire%E2%80%93intention_software_model) of multi-agent systems and understanding of logical programming concepts, i.e. [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog), as well as Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) is helpful (but not strictly required) to follow our tutorials.


1. [Develop an AgentSpeak Scenario in 15 Minutes](agentspeak-in-fifteen-minutes) is a minimal example to develop an agent scenario in 15 minutes from scratch with the current developer source codes of AgentSpeak.
2. [Trigger](trigger) is a tutorial to control the execution of an agent
3. [Actions](actions) is a tutorial to define own actions
4. [Communication](communication) is a tutorial on how to realise communication
5. [Environment](environment) is a tutorial to create an environment (which is not necessarily required in LightJason)
