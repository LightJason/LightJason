We would like to give credit to some people who helped us with our work by providing us with ideas, discussion or feedback to optimise our work continuously.

* Christoph Kuper - for his bachelor thesis, which provided us with a first draft of the architecture of a multi-agent system framework
* Jetbrains - for the development tools and license support
* Jörg P. Müller (as our Ph.D. supervisor) - for discussion, publication and feedback on the platform
* Marcel Spitzer - for his master research project in which he created an algorithm for measuring consistency of a multi-agent system
* Ehsan Tatasadi - for helping us with implementation and development, especially with UI design with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) in the [workshop simulation](/news/2017-09-workshop/) and the [scratchpad](/news/2017-11-scratchpad/)

__Thank you!__
