This project arises during our PhD time, because our research deals with [multi-agent systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_system).
Our research projects consider _traffic_ and _crowd simulation_, but we try to simulate _complex manner of human behaviour_.

> [Malte](/contact)'s research depends on _complex overtaking
> manoeuvre_ and _norm usage_ with the on a high
> abstraction level. The research contains a more
> application-based structure, but it is a great and
> helpful work, in which way a multi-agent system can
> be used in complex simulation scenarios.

> [Philipp](/contact)'s focus of research is the _high scalability_ of such
> complex simulation systems with data mining / big
> data and software developing aspects.
> His thesis mainly contains algorithms, data structure, software developing and formal structure.
> The applied software building process is inspired by [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) and
> [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) to get a long-live, robust
> software architecture.


Based on these perspectives, we can motivate our work.
Our work is inspired by [Jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net/), a multi-agent framework developed by Jomi F. HÃ¼bner and Rafael H. Bordini, wich we didn't use due to conflicts with our requirements. Instead we based our work on some of their theoretical concepts and ideas.

We tried a lot of different types of frameworks like [TerraME](http://www.terrame.org/), [FLAME](http://www.flame.ac.uk/), [GOAL](http://ii.tudelft.nl/trac/goal) or [MASON](http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/) to create an usable system for our simulation, but without success, so that we build up our framework from scratch.

From another point of view, we had compared the main _popular programming language indices_ [Tiobe](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), [RedMonk](http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2016/02/19/language-rankings-1-16/) and [PopularitY](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) in 2015 / 2016 and we found out, that agent-programming languages are not listed on any index, only _logical programming (Prolog)_ is found on Tiobe.
Our goal for this system is to create a practically usable and well documented framework which can also be used by non-software-developers and included in already existing projects. We try to explain the ideas, concepts and technical background in a clean and understandable way to get a better approval of agent-programming and modelling.
